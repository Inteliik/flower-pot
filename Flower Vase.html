         <li>Get a plastic bottle.</li>
         <li>Cut off the top, triangular part of the bottle. Dont throw it away as you will need it later.</li>              
         <li>From the bottle, cut off a not too thin ring.</li>
         <li>Keep it aside for now.</li>
         <li>Now, cut the bottle into strips from top but not fully all the way down.</li>      
         <li>From the topp of each strip, bend a little bit of the plastic outwards towards yourself.</li>
         <li>Hold all the strips together and slide the ring you cut earlier in.</li>
         <li>Let go of the strips and turn the bottle upside-down and press down spreading out the strips you cut.</li>
         <li>Keep the bottle upside down and attach the bent part of the the strips to the ring. </li>
         <li>After all of them have been attached, make sure its secure and turn the bottle rightside-up again. you will see that it has taken the form of a pot.</li>
         <li>Now, take the triangular part of the bottle, take off the cap and place it upside-down inside the pot you have created.</li>
         <li>Voila, you Flower Vase is ready to have some flowers in it.</li>
